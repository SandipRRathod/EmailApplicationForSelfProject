**Exploring the Inner Workings of Email and Gmail Applications** ðŸ“§

As someone passionate about understanding how digital communication tools operate, Iâ€™ve embarked on a project to explore the underlying mechanics of email applications, especially Gmail. ðŸš€

This project dives into various aspects such as:

- How emails are sent in real time
- The use of SMTP
- Building custom email services using Spring Boot and understanding how Gmail integrates into applications through APIs

The goal of this project is not only to build an email system from scratch but also to understand the complexities behind Gmailâ€™s architecture. ðŸ’»ðŸ”§

Itâ€™s exciting to learn about the technologies that power the tools we use every day and gain hands-on experience in implementing them. Stay tuned for more updates as I dive deeper into email systems and their functionalities!
