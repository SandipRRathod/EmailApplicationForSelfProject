### 💡 Curiosity Turned Project: Understanding How Email Applications Work 📧

Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you hit "Send" on an email? 🤔 This curiosity sparked the creation of my latest project. Through this, I'm diving into the mechanics of email systems, exploring how platforms like Gmail handle sending, receiving, and managing emails in real time.

🔍 **What this project covers:**
- Building a custom email-sending application.
- Implementing secure email protocols (SMTP, SSL/TLS).
- Exploring backend and frontend communication for email workflows.

💻 **Why this matters:**  
Email applications are something we use every day but rarely think about the technology powering them. By understanding their architecture, I'm not only satisfying my curiosity but also expanding my expertise in backend and API development.
